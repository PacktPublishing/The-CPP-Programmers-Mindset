# Exercises for Chapter 2

1. Implement the `ExpandingSearchRangeObject` from the "Iterating through the problem domain" section.
2. Write a compare-less operator for the `AddressBookRecord` class.
3. Write down specializations of the `ExactConversionTraits` trait for converting from `int64_t` to `double`.



Example solutions can be found in the `expanding_search_range.cpp`, `address_book_record.cpp`, 
and `conversion_traits.hpp` files. There might be more than one way to solve these exercises,
so your solution might differ from mine. See if yours pass the tests, or if they perform better.
